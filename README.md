# MITx_6.00.1x

6.00.1x did a good job of teaching me how to solve problems. Meaning, the course was less about how to write boilerplate code and more about how to solve problems efficiently, while considering the tradeoffs inherent in one approach versus another.

Taking this course, while working through "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs", has given me a good foundation to begin projects and learn more complex subject matter in computer science.

Included in another file will be my verified course certificate issued by edX.
