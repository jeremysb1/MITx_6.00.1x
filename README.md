# MITx_6.00.1x

This course improved my problem solving abilities. 

The course about how to solve problems efficiently, while considering the tradeoffs inherent in one approach versus another.

Taking this course, while working through "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs", gave me a good foundation to begin projects and learn more complex subject matter in computer science.

A verified course certificate issued by edX is included in a separate file.
