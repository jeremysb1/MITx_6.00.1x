# MITx_6.00.1x

This course did a good job of teaching me how to solve computational problems with Python.

One of the reasons I took this course is because of its level of rigor. Many of the programming assignments took a fair amount of time to complete and required me to think through the problems, as opposed to typing minimal amounts of code that "worked". I also received a lot of practice in reading code that was efficient, inefficient or would cause errors. I also gained a lot of clarity on tradeoffs of one type of approach versus other programs that would "work" but were less effiecient.

After completing the course, I possessed the ability to start my own projects. I also learned some fundamental ideas of computer science and programming (topics below), which led to my interest in learning C, C++, algorithms, as well as other topics in computer science, since I have a good starting point about how programs work.

While I did learn how to write code in Python. This course was much more than writing "boilerplate code". This course was a mental gym which increased my abilities and was the type of course I am smarter as a result of investing the time to put in the work to complete.
